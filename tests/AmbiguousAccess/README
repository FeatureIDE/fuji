What is tested: 
--------------- 

When JastAdd-parser creates an AST and meets an expression like
target.field.toString(), it can not deside, if target is a package, a field or a
type.  In this case it creates an AmbiguousAccess node.  This node will be
resolved later, when parser has enough info.  Correct resolution of an
AmbiguousAccess node in a refined type is generally possible only after all the
refinements are composed.  The test case checks correct resolution of
AmbiguousAccess nodes.

Correct output:
---------------
