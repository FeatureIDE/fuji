What is tested:
---------------

Import declarations from the base type and all the preceding refinememts must be
accessible to a refinement that is currently beeing composed.  Otherwise an
external type resolution might potentially fail.  In this test case the
resolution of Vector in the refinement fails and leads to that method m(Vector)
is not composed.

Correct output:
---------------

See *.ok files.
