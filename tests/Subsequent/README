What is tested:
---------------

- Method composition and original(): method p1.F1.F1_p1_Accessor() is refined in
  F2

- Classes that are first introduced in later features and not in the base
  feature must be correctly composed with their refinements: F2.p1.Later - base
  class, F3.p1.Later - refinement.

- Access to a member of a class that is first introduced in a later feature must
  be possible: F1.p1.Accesser -> F3.p1.Later.F3_p1_Later(), F1.p1.Accesser ->
  F2.p1.Later.F2_p1_Later().  The same accesses test accessing a class
  introduced in a later feature: class Later is not presetn in F1

- Compilation of a class introduced in a later feature and not referenced by any
  other class must be possible: StandAlone.java

- Compilation of classes not belonging to the FOP project but used in it must go
  well: F3.p1.Later -> lib.External

Correct output:
---------------

See *.ok files.
