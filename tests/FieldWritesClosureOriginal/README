Test case for the field writes closure analysis used in Fuji's -constWrites
option (that outputs fields (transitively) written by a constructor).

(FujiCompiler/src/fieldWritesClosure.jrag)

Test description:

A field wirte is triggered transitivelly by the constructor of Original/Edge:
Original/Edge.Edge(int, Node) -> Original/Edge.setHead(Node) -> 
Base/Edge.setHead(Node) -> write access to Edge.head.

The analysis must detect this field write access.
