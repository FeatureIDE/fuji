What is tested:
---------------

Class A is independent of I and is compiled without compiling I.  I references
A and A must be compiled together with I.  The test has to prove that A is
compiled only once, irrespectively of how many classes reference it.

Introduces statistics is used in this test because the output idirectly shows
which classes may be compiled how many times.

Correct output:
---------------

See *.ok files.
