Test case for the field writes closure analysis used in Fuji's -constWrites
option (that outputs fields (transitively) written by a constructor).

Test description:
Field writes are triggered transitivelly by a super-call in 
ConstructorCall/Edge constructor:
ConstructorCall/LabeledEdge.Edge --> Base/Edge -> write accesses to head and tail
                                 `-> ConstructorRefinement/Edge -> write accesses to newHead and newTail

The analysis must detect this field write access.
