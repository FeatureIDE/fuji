Test case for the field writes closure analysis used in Fuji's -constWrites
option (that outputs fields (transitively) written by a constructor).

(FujiCompiler/src/fieldWritesClosure.jrag)

Test description:

Field wirtes are triggered by constructors in nested classes.

The analysis must detect this field write access.
