Test case for the field writes closure analysis used in Fuji's -constWrites
option (that outputs fields (transitively) written by a constructor).

(FujiCompiler/src/fieldWritesClosure.jrag)

Test description:

This test case tests the correct behaviour on undefined fields, methods
and constructors.

The analysis should ignore undefined elements or print them as unknown.
