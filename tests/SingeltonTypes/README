What is tested:
---------------
The following explanation is now obsolete as Fuji has a base role and its 
refinement roles in one AST now.

A base class and its refinements are represented in Fuji by separate ASTs.
JastAddJ represent the same type in different ASTs by different objects.  This
can lead to failures, when JastAddJ tests equality of two types by testing the
equality of references this types are represented by.  If two types are equal
but come from different ASTs and thus represented by different objects, JastAddJ
will wrongly decide that the types are different.  This is solved by introducing
a type pool common for all ASTs.  This test case tests the solution.

Example error messages:
  Semantic Error: return value must be an instance of java.lang.String[] 
                                                which java.lang.String[] is not
  
  Semantic Error: no method named println(java.lang.String) in 
  java.io.PrintStream matches. However, there is a method println(long)

The test fails on a unsuccessful method composition too.

Correct output:
---------------

See *.ok files.
