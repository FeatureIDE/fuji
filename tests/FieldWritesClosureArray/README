Test case for the field writes closure analysis used in Fuji's -constWrites
option (that outputs fields (transitively) written by a constructor).

(FujiCompiler/src/fieldWritesClosure.jrag)

Test description:

The field in the test case is an array.  First the array is initialized (first 
field write), then the first element of the array is written (second filed
write).

Both field write access must be detected by the analysis.
