\subsection{OptInfoExtends2Steps}
%%
Dieser Testfall ähnelt dem Testfall \textbf{OptInfoExtends}, allerdings geht die Vererbungsbeziehung nun über zwei Stufen: Die Klasse \code{A} erweitert die Klasse \code{B}, die wiederum die Klasse \code{C} erweitert. Diese Information findet sich jeweils nur im Feature \feature{FeatureA} bzw. \feature{FeatureB}. Das Feld und die Methoden, auf die von der Klasse \code{D} des Features \feature{FeatureD} aus zugegriffen wird, finden sich nun in der Klasse \code{C} des Features \feature{FeatureC}.
\subsubsection{Fall 01: Die Features \feature{FeatureA} und \feature{FeatureB} sind im Feature-Modell als optional gekennzeichnet.} Dadurch kann es passieren, dass in einer Variante sämtliche Vererbungsinformationen nicht zur Verfügung stehen, wenn die Features \feature{FeatureA} und \feature{FeatureB} nicht ausgewählt wurden.
Dieser Fall löst insgesamt 24 Fehlermeldungen aus, die alle die Probleme thematisieren, die aus diesem möglichen Fehlen der Vererbungsinformationen entstehen.

Um diese Fehler zu beseitigen, ist es ausreichend, zum Feature-Modell die Constraints \constraint{FeatureA2 $\implies$ FeatureA} und
\constraint{FeatureB2 $\implies$ FeatureB} hinzuzufügen.
Dadurch muss, wenn das Feature \feature{FeatureA2} ausgewählt wurde, auch das Feature \feature{FeatureA} ausgewählt werden und wenn das Feature \feature{FeatureB2} ausgewählt wurde, auch das Feature \feature{FeatureB} ausgewählt werden. Allerdings können dadurch die Features \feature{FeatureA2} und \feature{FeatureB2} in keiner Variante mehr ausgewählt werden. Eine Auswahl des Features \feature{FeatureA2} würde im Feature-Modell zu einem Widerspruch führen, da das Feature \feature{FeatureA2} zum einen das Feature \feature{FeatureA} impliziert, zum anderen aber mit diesem in gegenseitigem Ausschluss steht. Analog für \feature{FeatureB2} und \feature{FeatureB}.

Um diese Fehler zu beseitigen, ist es ausreichend, zum Feature-Modell die Constraints \constraint{$\lnot$ FeatureA $\iff$ FeatureAA} und
\constraint{$\lnot$ FeatureB $\iff$ FeatureBB} hinzuzufügen.
Dadurch muss immer genau ein Exemplar der Klasse \code{A} und immer genau ein Exemplar der Klasse \code{B} mit den Vererbungsinformationen ausgewählt werden.
