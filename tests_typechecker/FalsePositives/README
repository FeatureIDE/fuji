OverwrittenMethod
-----------------

F1/A.java has method "bar" and uses it in method "foo".

Feature F2 is optional and F2/A.java overwirtes method "bar".

Fuji typechecker wrongly reports, that method "foo" access an optional method
"bar":
---
/tmp/test/F1/A.java:3:
  Semantic Error: MAYBE dependency:
Feature F1 accesses the method
  void bar() { ... }
of feature F2.
Feature F2 may not be present in every valid selection.
