  Semantic Error: 2 optional targets (there may be a valid selection where none of these targets is present):
Interface A of feature FeatureA2 accesses:
- in feature FeatureA as subinterface of interface B the field
     public static final int I = 42;
   of interface B.
- in feature FeatureAA as subinterface of interface B the field
     public static final int I = 42;
   of interface B.
There may be a valid selection where none of the features FeatureA and FeatureAA is present.
So it may be that the information that interface A (transitively) extends the interface(s) above is not present at all.
