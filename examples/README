We have applied Fuji to ten non-trivial feature-oriented programs.
This directory consists the sources of all programs as well as data
which we collected about the member accesses in the programs. For each
program there is a .csv file containing the data and a script that
invokes Fuji such that the data are collect once more.

lib - contains jars used by the example SPLs.
