All the changes made to original example projects are loged here.
=================================================================

* Prevayler 1
=============

Prevayler/PrevaylerComp.features:
base
Snapshot
Replication
Monitor
GZip
Censor

Error: Monitor/org/prevayler/implementation/journal/PersistentJournal.java:19:
Semantic Error: can not instantiate org.prevayler.foundation.DurableInputStream
no matching constructor found in org.prevayler.foundation.DurableInputStream

Explanation:
Prevayler/Monitor/org/prevayler/foundation/DurableInputStream.java:5 contains a
DurableInputStream(File,Monitor) constructor (introduction, not a refinement) with package access.

Prevayler/Monitor/org/prevayler/implementation/journal/PersistentJournal.java:19
try to instantiate a DurableInputStream instance using the
DurableInputStream(File,Monitor) constructor.  This leads to an access violation
because the constructor is accessed from a different package.

Change: access modifier of the constructor DurableInputStream(File,Monitor) in
Prevayler/Monitor/org/prevayler/foundation/DurableInputStream.java:5 is changed
from package to public.

* Prevayler 2
=============

Prevayler/PrevaylerComp.features: same as in Prevayler 1

Error: Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:74: Semantic Error: can not
instantiate org.prevayler.implementation.PrevaylerImpl no matching constructor
found in org.prevayler.implementation.PrevaylerImpl

Explanation: same as in Prevayler 1.
Prevayler/Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:74 accessing a
PrevaylerImpl(GenericSnapshotManager, TransactionPublisher, Serializer)
constructor (introduction, not a refinement) with package access in
Prevayler/Snapshot/org/prevayler/implementation/PrevaylerImpl.java:16

Change: access modifier of the constructor is changed to public.

* Prevayler 3
=============

Prevayler/PrevaylerComp.features: same as in Prevayler 1

Error: Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:76: Semantic Error:
statement is unreachable

Explanation: original() call after a throw statement in
Prevayler/Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:76

Change: comment out the line with original() call.

* Prevayler 4
=============

Prevayler/PrevaylerComp.features: same as in Prevayler 1

Error: Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:95: Semantic Error: can not
instantiate org.prevayler.implementation.journal.PersistentJournal no matching
constructor found in org.prevayler.implementation.journal.PersistentJournal

Explanation: same as in Prevayler 1.
Prevayler/Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:95: accessing a
PersistentJournal(PrevaylerDirectory, long, journalAgeThresholdInMillis, String,
Monitor) constructor (introduction, not a refinement) with package access in
Prevayler/Monitor/org/prevayler/implementation/journal/PersistentJournal.java:14

Change: access modifier of the constructor is changed to public.

* Prevayler 5
=============

Prevayler/PrevaylerComp.features: same as in Prevayler 1

Error: Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:47: Semantic Error: can not
instantiate org.prevayler.implementation.publishing.CentralPublisher no matching
constructor found in org.prevayler.implementation.publishing.CentralPublisher

Explanation: same as in Prevayler 1.
Prevayler/Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:47 accessing a
CentralPublisher(Clock, TransactionCensor, Journal) constructor (introduction,
not a refinement) with package access in
Prevayler/Censor/org/prevayler/implementation/publishing/CentralPublisher.java:3

Changed: access modifier of the constructor is changed to public.

* Prevayler 6
=============

Prevayler/PrevaylerComp.features: same as in Prevayler 1

Error: Snapshot/org/prevayler/PrevaylerFactory.java:49: Semantic Error:
statement is unreachable

Explanation: same as in Prevayler 3

Change: comment out the line with "throw ReturnHack.returnObject;"

* Prevayler 7
=============
Prevayler/PrevaylerComp.features: same as in Prevayler 1

While compiling the code generated by source-to-source translation with javac
1.6.0_20 :
sources/org/prevayler/implementation/journal/PersistentJournal.java:118:
variable input might not have been initialized input = this.hook76(journal,
input);

Explanation:
Prevayler/base/org/prevayler/implementation/journal/PersistentJournal.java:121
uses the uninitialized variable "input" declared on line 120.

Changed: the variable "input" is initialized to null on line 120.

NOTE: this change solved the problem with invalid bytecode generated by JastAddJ.  This is a bug in JastAddJ (http://bugs.jastadd.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41).  So Prevayler can be now compiled with Fuji too.

* MobileMedia8 1

Error:
includeCopyPhoto_includeMMAPI/lancs/mobilemedia/core/ui/controller/MusicPlayController.java:17,28:
Semantic Error: no field named midlet

Explanation:

MobileMedia8/includeCopyPhoto_includeMMAPI/lancs/mobilemedia/core/ui/controller/MusicPlayController.java:17,28
implements an abstract class
MobileMedia8/base/lancs/mobilemedia/core/ui/controller/AbstractController.java
which it its turn declares a protected field 'midlet'.

MusicPlayController declares on line 10 a nested static class
MusicPlayController_handleCommand which try to access the above-mentioned field
'midlet' from a non-static method hook35().  A non-static member ('midlet') can
not be accessed from a static context (nested static class).

Change: exclude MobileMedia8 from example SPLs, add ZipME SPL to examples.
ZipME SPL has more LOC than MobileMedia8.

* ZipMe 1
=========

A class ZipMe/Base/ZipMETest.java was added.  The class is used to test the
compiled SPL.

How to test:

1. cd to the directory with ZipMETest.class

2. run 'java ZipMETest'. ZipMETest will zip itself and then unzip the archive.
