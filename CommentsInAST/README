Some scatches to how to implement comments as AST nodes.  

The files in this dir contain changes made to corresponding files in 
JastAddJ/Java1.4Frontend that implement comments as AST nodes on BodyDecl 
level.  Comments on other levels can be implemented the same way.  

There must be a way not to change the original JastAddJ files, but make 
all the changes in Fuji/src like it was done with FOP modifiers 
(scanner/parser specs are composed by ant and jrags are refined).

CommentsInASTTest is a test case for a complete implementation of comments
as nodes.
