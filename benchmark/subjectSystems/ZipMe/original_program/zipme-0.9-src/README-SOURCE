==================================================================

zipME is a pure Java zip compression library for Java ME CLDC/MIDP
applications.

This library is mostly compatible with the java.util.zip package
in Java SE/CDC, so that an application can easily handle a zip file
in the same manner as that in Java SE/CDC.

This library is useful because the CLDC/MIDP doesn't officially
support the java.util.zip package or any of alternative zip
compression/uncompression libraries.

Required Software
------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build the zipME library and develop a MIDP application
using zipME, the following software are required:

 - Java SE JDK 5.0
   http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp

 - Ant 1.2 or later
   http://ant.apache.org/

 - Sun Java Wireless Toolkit (WTK) 2.5 for CLDC
   http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_5.html

How to Build zipME Library
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Setup the build environment

 Download the zipME source release and unzip it. You will find
 'build.xml' file under the top directory. Edit the build.xml and
 change the value of the 'wtk.home' property to your WTK's home.

2. Building the zipME library

 Under the directory where build.xml is located, run 'ant build'
 or just 'ant'. You will find 'zipme.jar' file is created under
 the 'lib' directory.

 To clean up the build, run 'ant clean'.

------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Use zipME Library
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Installing the zipME library to WTK's project

 Copy 'zipme.jar' file into WTK's 'apps/<your_project_name>/lib'
 directory, where <your_project_name> is your MIDP application's
 project directory.

2. Building a MIDP application using zipME

 Write application code that calls API in the net.sf.zipme.*
 package, and build it using WTK. zipME only requires the CLDC 1.0
 and the MIDP 1.0 API.
