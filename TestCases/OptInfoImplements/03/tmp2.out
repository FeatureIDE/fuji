/OptInfoImplements/03/FeatureA2/A.java:3,32:
  Semantic Error: 2 optional targets (there may be a valid selection where none of these targets is present):
Class A of feature FeatureA2 accesses:
- in feature FeatureA as implementation of interface B the field
     public static final int I = 42;
   of interface B.
- in feature FeatureAA as implementation of interface B the field
     public static final int I = 42;
   of interface B.
There may be a valid selection where none of the features FeatureA and FeatureAA is present.
So it may be that the information that class A (transitively) implements the interface(s) above is not present at all.
