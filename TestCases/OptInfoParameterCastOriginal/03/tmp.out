  Semantic Error: 2 optional targets (there may be a valid selection where none of these targets is present):
Class A of feature FeatureA2 accesses:
- in feature FeatureA as subclass of class B the super constructor
     public B()
   of class B.
- in feature FeatureAA as subclass of class B the super constructor
     public B()
   of class B.
There may be a valid selection where none of the features FeatureA and FeatureAA is present.
So it may be that the information that class A (transitively) extends the class(es) above is not present at all.
